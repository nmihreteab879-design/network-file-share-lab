The first step I took is connecting to a virtual machine I call dc-1 that will serve as the domain admin account and I also connected to a virtual machine I named client-1 which will serve as a normal user.

I then went into the dc-1(domain admin account) virtual machine and went to file explorer and pressed on windows(c:) and created 4 folders: read acess folder, write access folder, no acess folder and the accounting folder

I then changed the access for the read acess to read by right clicking the read acess folder then I pressed properites and then pressed sharing and then share. I then typed domain users and gave the domain users read acess.

I then went to the write access folder
