The first step I took is connecting to a virtual machine I call dc-1 that will serve as the domain admin account and I also connected to a virtual machine I named client-1 which will serve as a normal user.

I then went into the dc-1(domain admin account) virtual machine and went to file explorer and pressed on windows(c:) and created 3 folders: read acess folder, write access folder, no acess and the no acess folder
